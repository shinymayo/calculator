Final project of The Odin Project - Foundations.

1. Should contain functions for all of the basic math operators (add, subtract,
multiply, divide)

2. Calculator operation will consiste of a number, an operator, and another number
Create 3 variable for each parts of a calculator operation. Will use these variable
to update your display later.

3. Create function operate that takes operator and 2 numbers and then calls one of
the above functions on numbers.

4. Create basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit, each of the above
functions, clear button and "=" button. Create a display for calculator.

5. Create the functions that populate the display when you click the number buttons.
You should be storing the ‘display value’ in a variable somewhere for use in the
next step.

6. Make the calculator work! You’ll need to store the first number and second number that
are input into the calculator, utilize the operator that the user selects, and then 
operate() on the two numbers when the user presses the “=” key. You should already have 
the code that can populate the display, so once operate() has been called, update the 
display with the ‘solution’ to the operation. This is the hardest part of the project. 
You need to figure out how to store all the values and call the operate function 
with them.
